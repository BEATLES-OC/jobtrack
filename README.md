JobTrack
===================

The JobTrack application is intended as a learning platform for the integration of FuelPHP (http://fuelphp.com),
a PHP backend, and the Backbone.js (http://backbonejs.org/) Javascript framework.

My goal with the project is not to neccesarily make a fully-functioning application, but rather to learn about
the challenges associated with integration a RESTful API backend into Backbone.

The functionality of the system includes:
- Being able to store position information
- Storing Applicant information

ToDo:
- Using tagging to link position with applicants
- Create more "summary" pages
